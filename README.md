Step 1: Select a real-world dataset.
Step 2: Perform data preparation and cleaning
 Load the dataset into Jupyter notebook
 Explore the basic information about the data, e.g., size of data ranges, some basic
statistics etc.
 Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data
 Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, feature engineering, create additional
columns etc.)
Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis and visualization
 Compute statistics for numeric columns
 Explore distribution of numeric columns using histograms etc.
 Explore relationship between various columns
 Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis
Step 4: Train and evaluate two machine learning models, tune hyperparameters and reduce the
overfitting to improve the model.
